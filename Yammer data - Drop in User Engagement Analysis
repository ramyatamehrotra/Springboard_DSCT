/*Do the answers to any of your original hypotheses lead you to further questions?
If so, what are they and how will you test them?
If they are questions that you canâ€™t answer using data alone, how would you go about answering them (hypothetically, assuming you actually worked at this company)?
What seems like the most likely cause of the engagement dip?
What, if anything, should the company do in response?*/

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', e.occurred_at),

  FROM tutorial.yammer_events e
 WHERE e.event_type = 'engagement'
   AND e.event_name = 'login'

 ORDER BY 1

--With the help of above query, we can see that there is a dip in the logins in August first week , as the
--numbers go down from 1442 to 1266.

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', e.occurred_at),
       e.event_type,

  FROM tutorial.yammer_events e
 --WHERE e.event_type = 'engagement'
   --AND e.event_name = 'login'
 GROUP BY 1,2
 ORDER BY 1

----Answer1:
--By running the above,we see that in August first week, even the sign up_flow goes down though if we look at the 
--historical data, that attribute fluctuates, so our focus should be in understanding why engagement went down nad
--continued to decrease.

----Answer2:
--Why is the engagement decreasing, is it a particular channel which is causing the decrease, is there an issue
--that I can't see through data and would require communicating with product teams? 
--I start by looking at the engagement numbers coming in via different channels(computer, phone, tablet)

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', occurred_at) AS week,
       COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) AS weekly_active_users,

  FROM tutorial.yammer_events e
 WHERE e.event_type = 'engagement'

 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 1
LIMIT 100

----Answer3:
--I see that phone engagement started decreasing in the first week of August and continued decreasing untill it 
--picked up again in the end. Why this happened is not clear from the data, so I would reach out to the product team
--to understand if there has been any recent release for mobile apps or if something is broken and is causing this issue.
--None the less, I would show them these numbers so they can help me understand what might have caused this dip.


SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', e.occurred_at),
       COUNT(CASE WHEN action = 'email_clickthrough' then e.user_id else NULL end) as wkly_active_usrs_clickthrough,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN action = 'email_open' then e.user_id end) as wkly_active_usrs_email_open,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN action = 'sent_reengagement_email' then e.user_id end) as wkly_active_usrs_reengage,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN action = 'sent_weekly_digest' then e.user_id end) as wkly_active_usrs_wkly_digest
  FROM tutorial.yammer_events e
  LEFT JOIN tutorial.yammer_emails em
  on e.user_id = em.user_id
 WHERE e.event_type = 'engagement'
   AND e.event_name = 'login'
 GROUP BY 1
 ORDER BY 1
 
 ----Answer3: (continued)
 --It is good to check if any of the actins taken caused it, though you can't say why but you can see that
 --the weekly digest numbers did see a major drop and continued decreasing. So this is another thing that I would 
 --suggest the product team to verify. This will narrow down their area of focus and help them identify the cause of the issue 
 --quickly.
 
 ----Answer4:
 --It looks like weekly digest and mobile app are the major causes for the dip and need further research.
 
----Answer5:
--Few actions that the company should take are:
--1) Check what's wrong with the mobile app and fix it. 
--2) Communicate the issue and the fix to the users.
--3) Understand why weekly digest saw the dip and take actions accordingly.
